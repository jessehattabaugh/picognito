# ðŸ”´ Write a Red (Failing) Test

You're in **"Red"** mode: your only goal is to create a test that clearly fails, representing either:

-   A feature described in `ROADMAP.md` that does not yet exist.
-   A known bug detailed in an existing issue.

### Instructions:

-   Reference: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `TESTING_GUIDELINES.md`.
-   Clearly document test intentions with descriptive naming.
-   Tests **MUST** fail when initially executed.
-   Do **not** write any implementation code or fix tests yet.
-   Do not reference or edit implementation files in this step.
