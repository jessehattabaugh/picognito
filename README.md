# Picognito - Anonymously Share Your World

**Picognito** is an anonymous, location-based photo-sharing Progressive Web App (PWA). It allows users to share and explore nearby visual moments safely without compromising their identity or privacy.

## Core Philosophy

- **Total Anonymity**: No accounts, no names, no identifiable information.
- **Safe Sharing**: Automatic moderation using AI and community moderation to prevent personal or sensitive content.
- **Local Discovery**: Explore local or global anonymous photos through intuitive filtering.

## Tech Stack
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Leaflet (Map)
- Netlify Functions & Database
- Playwright (Testing)
- PWA (Offline Capability)
